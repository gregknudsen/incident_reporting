# My Approach

This was a quick little Vue3 app I spun up to complete the mini project. I chose Vue because my most recent position used it, and, given the time constraints, I thought it best not to wander too far away from my comfort zone.

## Work Breakdown

#### Time breakdown

- ~ 6 hours
  - 4 hours coding/implementing core functionality
  - 2 hours clean up/styling/documnetation

## TODOS

Clearly, there are **many** items I would have liked to address, but I'll just list a few here.

- I wasn't sure what data was most pertinent to display, so I would definitely work with the stakeholders to determine what data they would want displayed
- mobile responsiveness
- would move buisiness logic (like reading data from `json` files) into separate file
- more styling of the incidents in right side panels
  - would like to link clicking popup to right side panels

Additionally, I made a few comments in the code detailing other possible enhancements.

Again, thank you so much for the opportunity!
